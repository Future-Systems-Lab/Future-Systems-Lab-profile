## 🧭 Mission, Vision & Values

### Mission
Future Systems Lab designs and validates **end-to-end, decentralized systems** by using **healthcare—particularly mental health—as the ultimate stress test** for compliance, governance, and interoperability. By integrating applied informatics, decentralized identity, and blockchain-based consent architectures, the lab demonstrates that if secure, scalable systems can operate here, they can scale across any complex enterprise or global domain.

### Vision
To establish a systems benchmark where **data sovereignty, verifiable consent, and governance-aware infrastructure** are proven under maximum regulatory and operational constraint—enabling decentralized architectures that are interoperable by design and transferable across industries, markets, and jurisdictions.

### Core Values

**Integrity**  
Data accuracy, reproducibility, and audit-ready transparency across the full system lifecycle

**Scalability**  
Architectures designed to function locally, interoperate globally, and adapt across domains without redesign

**Autonomy**  
User-controlled identity, consent, and participation embedded as foundational infrastructure primitives

**Governance**  
Compliance-aware design integrated directly into decentralized systems to support accountability, risk mitigation, and regulatory alignment

## 🔒 Access & Repository Policy

The architecture diagrams, Mermaid source files, and supporting documentation referenced across this organization are maintained in **private, invite-only repositories**.

Public access is intentionally restricted to protect **pre-commercial IP, security design, and governance logic**.

Access to these design artifacts is available to **recruiters, academic reviewers, and partners upon request**.

---

## 🔍 Verification & Reproducibility

Each published architecture PNG is paired with a matching Mermaid source file to ensure reproducibility.

To verify a diagram:
1. Open the corresponding `.mmd` file from `architecture/mermaid/`
2. Paste its contents into the Mermaid Live Editor
3. Confirm it renders identically to the PNG

This approach supports academic reproducibility, governance alignment, and documentation traceability across:
Security • Wearables • Full Systems • Blockchain • AI / Data
